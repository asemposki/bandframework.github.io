    We've released <a href='https://surmise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'>surmise</a>. surmise is a Python package that's designed to provide a
    surrogate model interface for calibration, uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis. An example is provided with the package 
    so please go ahead and get in and play! Comments & questions to <a <a href="mailto:ozgesurer2019@u.northwestern.edu">Ozge Surer</a> who, 
    together with Moses Chan & Matt Plumlee, developed this very useful tool.

    The First Annual BAND Camp was a great success! Daniel Phillips (OU) gave an overview of BAND,
    Michael Grosskopf (LANL) reviewed "Bayesian Basics",
    Simon Mak (Duke) and Derek Everitt (OSU) explained "Model Emulation and Parameter Estimation",
    and Matt Pratola (OSU) went through "Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics: Early Directions in Bayesian Model Mixing‚Äù.
    The slides for the BAND Camp as well as for the Virtual ISNET 8 workshop that followed can be found <a href='https://indico.frib.msu.edu/event/21/page/353-program-zoom-links'>here</a>.
