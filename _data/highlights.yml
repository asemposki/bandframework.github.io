- title: Lightweight self-conjugate nucleus <sup>80</sup>Zr
  description: >
    This work provides evidence for the existence of a deformed double shell closure in 80Zr 
    through high precision Penning trap mass measurements of 80-83Zr.

- title: Fast &amp; Accurate Two-Body Scattering Emulator
  description: >
    Bayesian analysis for experimental design often requires very many calculations with 
    different parameters, which is too expensive. Here we extend Eigenvector Continuation
    to create emulators that calculate two-body scattering observables directly (i.e., without needing wave functions).

- title: Two-body scattering emulator without Kohn anomalies
  description: >
    Fast &amp; accurate emulators are needed to perform Bayesian analyses for complex nuclear reactions. 
    We construct an emulator using Eigenvector Continuation applied to the (general) Kohn variational principle (KVP)
    but without Kohn anomalies.
