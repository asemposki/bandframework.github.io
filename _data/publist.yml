  description: >
    We describe the Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics (BAND) framework, 
    a cyberinfrastructure that we are developing which will unify the treatment of nuclear models, 
    experimental data, and associated uncertainties. 
    We overview the statistical principles and nuclear-physics contexts underlying the BAND toolset,
    with an emphasis on Bayesian methodology's ability to leverage insight from multiple models. 
    In order to facilitate understanding of these tools we provide a simple and accessible example of the BAND framework's application. 
    Four case studies are presented to highlight how elements of the framework will enable progress on complex, far-ranging problems in nuclear physics. 
    By collecting notation and terminology, providing illustrative examples, and giving an overview of the associated techniques, 
    this paper aims to open paths through which the nuclear physics and statistics communities can contribute to and build upon the BAND framework.

- title: "Efficient emulators for scattering using eigenvector continuation"
  image: EC_parameters.png
  description: >
    Eigenvector continuation (EC), which accurately and efficiently reproduces ground states 
    for targeted sets of Hamiltonian parameters, is extended to scattering using the Kohn 
    variational principle. Proofs-of-principle imply EC will be a valuable emulator for 
    applying Bayesian inference to parameter estimation constrained by scattering observables.
