- title: "Get on the BAND Wagon: A Bayesian Framework for Quantifying Model Uncertainties in Nuclear Dynamics"
  image: flowchart_tikz_paper_truncated.png
  description: >
    We describe the Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics (BAND) framework, 
    a cyberinfrastructure that we are developing which will unify the treatment of nuclear models, 
    experimental data, and associated uncertainties. 
    We overview the statistical principles and nuclear-physics contexts underlying the BAND toolset,
    with an emphasis on Bayesian methodology's ability to leverage insight from multiple models. 
    In order to facilitate understanding of these tools we provide a simple and accessible example of the BAND framework's application. 
    Four case studies are presented to highlight how elements of the framework will enable progress on complex, far-ranging problems in nuclear physics. 
    By collecting notation and terminology, providing illustrative examples, and giving an overview of the associated techniques, 
    this paper aims to open paths through which the nuclear physics and statistics communities can contribute to and build upon the BAND framework.

- title: "Machine-Learning-Based Inversion of Nuclear Responses"
  image: bestworstresponse6.png
  description: >
    A microscopic description of the interaction of atomic nuclei with external electroweak probes is required for elucidating 
    aspects of short-range nuclear dynamics and for the correct interpretation of neutrino oscillation experiments. Nuclear 
    quantum Monte Carlo methods infer the nuclear electroweak response functions from their Laplace transforms. Inverting the 
    Laplace transform is a notoriously ill-posed problem; and Bayesian techniques, such as maximum entropy, are typically used 
    to reconstruct the original response functions in the quasielastic region. In this work, we present a physics-informed 
    artificial neural network architecture suitable for approximating the inverse of the Laplace transform. Utilizing simulated, 
    albeit realistic, electromagnetic response functions, we show that this physics-informed artificial neural network outperforms 
    maximum entropy in both the low-energy transfer and the quasielastic regions, thereby allowing for robust calculations of 
    electron scattering and neutrino scattering on nuclei and inclusive muon capture rates.

- title: "Fast & accurate emulation of two-body scattering observables without wave functions"
  image: np_tot_cs_werr_SMS_n4lo_plus_Lambda450MeV.png
  description: >
    We combine Newton's variational method with ideas from eigenvector continuation to construct a fast & accurate emulator 
    for two-body scattering observables. The emulator will facilitate the application of rigorous statistical methods for 
    interactions that depend smoothly on a set of free parameters. 
    When used to emulate the neutron-proton cross section with a modern chiral interaction as a function of 26 free parameters, 
    it reproduces the exact calculation with negligible error and provides an over 300x improvement in CPU time.

- title: "Efficient emulators for scattering using eigenvector continuation"
  image: EC_parameters.png
  description: >
    Eigenvector continuation (EC), which accurately and efficiently reproduces ground states 
    for targeted sets of Hamiltonian parameters, is extended to scattering using the Kohn 
    variational principle. Proofs-of-principle imply EC will be a valuable emulator for 
    applying Bayesian inference to parameter estimation constrained by scattering observables.

- title: "Does Bayesian Model Averaging improve polynomial extrapolations? Two toy problems as tests"
  image: g2far.png
  description: >
      We assess the accuracy of Bayesian polynomial extrapolations from small parameter values
      to large ones. We employ Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to combine results from different order polynomials. 
      Our study considers two "toy problems" where the underlying function used to generate data sets is known. 
      We use Bayesian parameter estimation to extract the polynomial coefficients and BMA different polynomial degrees 
      by weighting each according to its Bayesian evidence. We compare the predictive performance of this Bayesian Model Average
      with that of the individual polynomials.
