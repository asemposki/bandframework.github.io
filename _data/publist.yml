  image: flowchart_tikz_paper_truncated.png
  description: >
    We describe the Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics (BAND) framework, 
    a cyberinfrastructure that we are developing which will unify the treatment of nuclear models, 
    experimental data, and associated uncertainties. 
    We overview the statistical principles and nuclear-physics contexts underlying the BAND toolset,
    with an emphasis on Bayesian methodology's ability to leverage insight from multiple models. 
    In order to facilitate understanding of these tools we provide a simple and accessible example of the BAND framework's application. 
    Four case studies are presented to highlight how elements of the framework will enable progress on complex, far-ranging problems in nuclear physics. 
    By collecting notation and terminology, providing illustrative examples, and giving an overview of the associated techniques, 
    this paper aims to open paths through which the nuclear physics and statistics communities can contribute to and build upon the BAND framework.

- title: "Machine-Learning-Based Inversion of Nuclear Responses"
  image: bestworstresponse6.png
  description: >
    A microscopic description of the interaction of atomic nuclei with external electroweak probes is required for elucidating 
    aspects of short-range nuclear dynamics and for the correct interpretation of neutrino oscillation experiments. Nuclear 
    quantum Monte Carlo methods infer the nuclear electroweak response functions from their Laplace transforms. Inverting the 
    Laplace transform is a notoriously ill-posed problem; and Bayesian techniques, such as maximum entropy, are typically used 
    to reconstruct the original response functions in the quasielastic region. In this work, we present a physics-informed 
    artificial neural network architecture suitable for approximating the inverse of the Laplace transform. Utilizing simulated, 
    albeit realistic, electromagnetic response functions, we show that this physics-informed artificial neural network outperforms 
    maximum entropy in both the low-energy transfer and the quasielastic regions, thereby allowing for robust calculations of 
    electron scattering and neutrino scattering on nuclei and inclusive muon capture rates.

  description: >
    We combine Newton's variational method with ideas from eigenvector continuation to construct a fast & accurate emulator 
    for two-body scattering observables. The emulator will facilitate the application of rigorous statistical methods for 
    interactions that depend smoothly on a set of free parameters. 
    When used to emulate the neutron-proton cross section with a modern chiral interaction as a function of 26 free parameters, 
    it reproduces the exact calculation with negligible error and provides an over 300x improvement in CPU time.

      We assess the accuracy of Bayesian polynomial extrapolations from small parameter values

  description: >
      We construct an efficient emulator for two-body scattering observables using the general (complex) Kohn 
      variational principle and trial wave functions derived from eigenvector continuation. The emulator simultaneously 
      evaluates an array of Kohn variational principles associated with different boundary conditions, which allows for the detection 
      and removal of spurious singularities known as Kohn anomalies. When applied to the K-matrix only, our emulator resembles the one constructed 
      by Furnstahl et al. (2020) although with reduced numerical noise. After a few applications to real potentials, we emulate differential 
      cross sections for 40Ca(n,n) scattering based on a realistic optical potential and quantify the model uncertainties using Bayesian methods. These 
      calculations serve as a proof of principle for future studies aimed at improving optical models.

- title: "Precision measurement of lightweight self-conjugate nucleus 80Zr"
  image: 80ZrBMAEDFs.png
  description: >
        Protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus move in shells analogous to the electronic shell structures of atoms. 
        The nuclear shell structure varies as a result of changes in the nuclear mean field with the number of neutrons N 
        and protons Z, and these variations can be probed by measuring the mass differences between nuclei. The N = Z = 40 
        self-conjugate nucleus 80Zr is of particular interest, as its proton and neutron shell structures are expected to 
        be very similar, and its ground state is highly deformed. Here we provide evidence for the existence of a deformed 
        double-shell closure in 80Zr through high-precision Penning trap mass measurements of 80–83Zr. Our mass values show 
        that 80Zr is substantially lighter, and thus more strongly bound than predicted. This can be attributed to the 
        deformed shell closure at N = Z = 40 and the large Wigner energy. A statistical Bayesian-model mixing analysis 
        employing several global nuclear mass models demonstrates difficulties with reproducing the observed mass anomaly 
        using current theory.

- title: "Rigorous constraints on three-nucleon forces in chiral effective field theory from fast and accurate calculations of few-body observables"
  image: Qcbarposterior.png
  description: >
         We explore the constraints on the three-nucleon force (3NF) of chiral effective field theory (ChiEFT)
         that are provided by bound-state observables in the A=3 and A=4 sectors. Our statistically rigorous 
         analysis incorporates experimental error, computational method uncertainty, and the uncertainty due to 
         truncation of the ChiEFT expansion at next-to-next-to-leading order. A consistent solution for the 
         3H binding energy, the 4He binding energy and radius, and the 3H beta-decay rate can only be obtained if 
         ChiEFT truncation errors are included in the analysis. The beta-decay rate is the only one of these that 
         yields a nondegenerate constraint on the 3NF low-energy constants, which makes it crucial for the parameter 
         estimation. We use eigenvector continuation for fast and accurate emulation of no-core shell model 
         calculations of the few-nucleon observables. This facilitates sampling of the posterior probability 
         distribution, allowing us to also determine the distributions of the parameters that quantify the truncation error. 
         We find a ChiEFT expansion parameter of Q=0.33 ± 0.06 for these observables.

- title: "Statistical tools for a better optical model"
  image: 48CaSensitivities.png
  description: >
         Modern statistical tools provide the ability to compare the information content of observables and 
         provide a path to explore which experiments would be most useful to give insight into and constrain theoretical models.
         In this work we study three such tools, (i) the principal component analysis, (ii) the sensitivity analysis based on derivatives, 
         and (iii) the Bayesian evidence. This is done in the context of nuclear reactions with the goal of constraining the optical potential.
         We first apply these tools to a toy-model case. Then we consider two different reaction observables, elastic angular distributions
         and polarization data for reactions on 48Ca and 208Pb at two different beam energies. For the toy-model case, we find significant 
         discrimination power in the sensitivities and the Bayesian evidence, showing clearly that the volume imaginary term is more useful 
         to describe scattering at higher energies. When comparing between elastic cross sections and polarization data using realistic optical 
         models, sensitivity studies indicate that both observables are roughly equally sensitive but the variability of the optical model 
         parameters is strongly angle dependent. The Bayesian evidence shows some variability between the two observables, but the Bayes factor 
         obtained is not sufficient to discriminate between angular distributions and polarization.

  description: >
         Measurements from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) can be used to study the properties
         of quark-gluon plasma. Systematic constraints on these properties must combine measurements from different collision systems and methodically 
         account for experimental and theoretical uncertainties. Such studies require a vast number of costly numerical simulations. While computationally 
         inexpensive surrogate models ("emulators") can be used to efficiently approximate the predictions of heavy ion simulations across a broad range of
         model parameters, training a reliable emulator remains a computationally expensive task. We use transfer learning to map the parameter dependencies
         of one model emulator onto another, leveraging similarities between different simulations of heavy ion collisions. By limiting the need for large 
         numbers of simulations to only one of the emulators, this technique reduces the numerical cost of comprehensive uncertainty quantification when 
         studying multiple collision systems and exploring different models.

         State-of-the-art hydrodynamic models of heavy-ion collisions have considerable theoretical model uncertainties in the description of the 
         very early pre-hydrodynamic stage. We add a new computational module, KTIso, that describes the pre-hydrodynamic evolution kinetically, 
         based on the relativistic Boltzmann equation with collisions treated in the Isotropization Time Approximation. As a novelty, KTIso allows 
         for the inclusion and evolution of initial-state momentum anisotropies. To maintain computational efficiency KTIso assumes strict 
         longitudinal boost invariance and allows collisions to isotropize only the transverse momenta. We use it to explore the sensitivity 
         of hadronic observables measured in relativistic heavy-ion collisions to initial-state momentum anisotropies and microscopic scattering 
         during the pre-hydrodynamic stage.

- title: "Black Box Variational Bayesian Model Averaging"
  image: VBMAPredictiveCoverage.png
  description: >
        For many decades now, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) has been a popular framework to systematically account for model uncertainty 
        that arises in situations when multiple competing models are available to describe the same or similar physical process. The implementation 
        of this framework, however, comes with a multitude of practical challenges including posterior approximation via Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
        and numerical integration. We present a Variational Bayesian Inference approach to BMA as a viable alternative to the standard solutions 
        which avoids many of the aforementioned pitfalls. The proposed method is “black box” in the sense that it can be readily applied to many 
        models with little to no model-specific derivation. We illustrate the utility of our variational approach on a suite of examples and discuss 
        all the necessary implementation details. Fully documented Python code with all the examples is provided as well.

  description: > 
        We treat low-energy 3He-alpha elastic scattering  in an Effective Field Theory (EFT) that exploits the separation of scales in this reaction. 
        We compute the amplitude up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO), developing a hierarchy of the effective-range parameters that contribute 
        at various orders. We use the resulting formalism to analyze data for recent measurements at center-of-mass energies of 0.38-3.12 MeV using the 
        SONIK gas target at TRIUMF as well as older data in this energy regime. We employ a likelihood function that incorporates the theoretical 
        uncertainty due to truncation of the EFT and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to obtain the resulting posterior probability distribution. 
        We find that the inclusion of a small amount of data on the analysing power $A_y$ is crucial to determine the sign of the p-wave splitting in 
        such an analysis. The combination of Ay and SONIK data constrains all effective-range parameters up to O(p^4) in both s- and p-waves quite well. 
        The ANCs and s-wave scattering length are consistent with a recent EFT analysis of the capture reaction 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be.

- title: "Nudged elastic band approach to nuclear fission pathways"
  image: NEBfission.png
  description: >
        The nuclear fission process is a dramatic example of the large-amplitude collective motion in which the nucleus undergoes a series of shape changes
        before splitting into distinct fragments. This motion can be represented by a pathway in the many-dimensional space of collective coordinates. Within 
        a stationary framework rooted in a static collective Schrödinger equation, the collective action along the fission pathway determines the spontaneous 
        fission half-lives as well as mass and charge distributions of fission fragments. We study the performance and precision of various methods to 
        determine the minimum-action and minimum-energy fission trajectories in two- and three-dimensional collective spaces. These methods include the nudged 
        elastic band method (NEB), grid-based methods, and the Euler-Lagrange approach to the collective action minimization. The NEB method is capable of 
        efficient determination of the exit points on the outer turning surface that characterize the most probable fission pathway and constitute the key 
        input for fission studies. The NEB method will be particularly useful in large-scale static fission calculations of superheavy nuclei and neutron-rich 
        fissioning nuclei contributing to the astrophysical r-process recycling.

      The statistical correlations between nuclear deformations and charge radii of different nuclei are affected by the underlying shell structure.
