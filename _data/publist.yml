  description: >
    We describe the Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics (BAND) framework, 
    a cyberinfrastructure that we are developing which will unify the treatment of nuclear models, 
    experimental data, and associated uncertainties. 
    We overview the statistical principles and nuclear-physics contexts underlying the BAND toolset,
    with an emphasis on Bayesian methodology's ability to leverage insight from multiple models. 
    In order to facilitate understanding of these tools we provide a simple and accessible example of the BAND framework's application. 
    Four case studies are presented to highlight how elements of the framework will enable progress on complex, far-ranging problems in nuclear physics. 
    By collecting notation and terminology, providing illustrative examples, and giving an overview of the associated techniques, 
    this paper aims to open paths through which the nuclear physics and statistics communities can contribute to and build upon the BAND framework.

- title: "Machine-Learning-Based Inversion of Nuclear Responses"
  image: bestworstresponse6.png
  description: >
    A microscopic description of the interaction of atomic nuclei with external electroweak probes is required for elucidating 
    aspects of short-range nuclear dynamics and for the correct interpretation of neutrino oscillation experiments. Nuclear 
    quantum Monte Carlo methods infer the nuclear electroweak response functions from their Laplace transforms. Inverting the 
    Laplace transform is a notoriously ill-posed problem; and Bayesian techniques, such as maximum entropy, are typically used 
    to reconstruct the original response functions in the quasielastic region. In this work, we present a physics-informed 
    artificial neural network architecture suitable for approximating the inverse of the Laplace transform. Utilizing simulated, 
    albeit realistic, electromagnetic response functions, we show that this physics-informed artificial neural network outperforms 
    maximum entropy in both the low-energy transfer and the quasielastic regions, thereby allowing for robust calculations of 
    electron scattering and neutrino scattering on nuclei and inclusive muon capture rates.

- title: "Efficient emulators for scattering using eigenvector continuation"
  image: EC_parameters.png
  description: >
    Eigenvector continuation (EC), which accurately and efficiently reproduces ground states 
    for targeted sets of Hamiltonian parameters, is extended to scattering using the Kohn 
    variational principle. Proofs-of-principle imply EC will be a valuable emulator for 
    applying Bayesian inference to parameter estimation constrained by scattering observables.
