# Instructions for the BAND Framework website

The website is powered by Jekyll, with all of the content in text files, which are in subdirectories in the bandframework.github.io respository of the bandframework organization. The website is [https://github.com/bandframework/bandframework.github.io](https://github.com/bandframework/bandframework.github.io). 

Note that you can make edits directly on the files in your web browser.

If, after your changes have been pushed, you received an email that there was an error in the Jekyll processing that is not obviously fixed, please forward the email to Dick (furnstahl.1@osu.ed).
